            <p id="aboutmetext">Hi, I'm Josh!<br>
I'm a (mostly) self-taught Music-Producer/Composer and Artist from New Zealand; Also known online as 'Hekit' or 'Buizelsocks'.<br><br>
I’m also a Programmer, Graphic Designer, Game-Enthusiast, Fussy Colour Theorist, and Semi-Colon Enjoyer.
I often draw silly animal or inanimate-object based characters, and make concept-centric music inspired by various media;
My work often draws insperation from the indie game and animation scene, as well as various corners of geek and internet culture
such as Y2K/Frutiger Aero, Dreamcore and Liminal Spaces.
